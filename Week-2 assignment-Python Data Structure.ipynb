    "2) It is a name given to a location in memory\n",

    "### Variable Declaration:\n",
    "1. Variable names must start with a letter (**either lowercase or uppercase**) or an underscore (**_**).\n",
    "2. After the initial character, variable names can consist of letters (both lowercase and uppercase), digits (0-9), or underscores.\n",
    "3. Variable names are case-sensitive. This means that names with different letter casing are treated as different variables. For example, **myVariable** and **myvariable** are considered distinct variables.\n",
    "4. Python has some reserved keywords that cannot be used as variable names because they have special meanings in the language. You should avoid using these reserved words as variable names. Some examples of reserved words in Python include **if**, **else**, **for**, **while**, **import**, and **class**, among others.\n",
    "5. Name shouls be descriptive and meaningful for variables to enhance the readability of code. Variable names should convey the purpose or content of the variable.\n",
    "6. Use underscores (**_**) as **commas and blanks** are not allowed to separate words in variable names to improve readability. This is known as snake_case. For example, **my_variable_name** is a more readable choice than **myvariablename**.\n",
